# Reporting
Reporting is a Service Management System that keeps track of all service requests, monitors all the tasks assignments and finally generates customized reports.

PLEASE NOTE: Reporting is in the early stages of development and therefore is likely to contain bugs and unfinished features. so this means that it is still work in progress.
